<h3>About the back end</h3>

<p>This is the back end of my doggy play date app.  This back end is built in express runnin on node.js.  I set up a mongoDB database, and connected to that database via Mongoose.</p>

<p>There are two collections that my backend has access to. A list of users including login information, and a list of playdates with user id's of both parties, and information about the playdate itself.</p>

<p>There are main routes which serve user information to the front end, as well as playdates and dogs routes which do the same.</p>
